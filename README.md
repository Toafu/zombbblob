## A superset of PotatoBot

## PotatoBot Specs

✅ a way for staff to assign/remove roles (it might be easier to use a universal syntax for all roles like "/assign staff" instead of $staff, which is not as efficient  
✅ the ability to create invites with number of uses (e.g., /invite N)  
✅ the ability to create channels for a semester (e.g. /create F22) - the current configured channels are general, labs, project-1, project-2, project-3, project-4, midterm-exam, final-exam, and random (still needs archiving but at least automatically manages permissions)  
✅ the ability to role react to the message in update-role (the message ID is 926654292524404817)  
✅ the ability to autoassign students the alumni role at the end of a semester. Currently, the bot goes through all the users with a student role and assigns them with the alumni role on 1/1 (for all users that joined on or before 12/20 of the previous year), 5/1 (for all users that joined on or before 4/27), and 7/1 (for all users that joined on or before 6/30). However, there's probably a better way to do this (you can also range assign a role using a command like /alumnize student 2021-12-21 2021-12-31  
✅ The automatic portion of this command seems to work at a small scale.  
✅ There should be a command to make PotatoBot send custom messages, but only accessible by staff in the staff chat  
✅ There should be a command to make PotatoBot react to any message, also only accessible by staff in the staff chat  

ulgut and slime are working on a verification feature
